# Translating evidence into actionable implementation strategy

## Evidence Generalizability Assessment (7 Questions Framework - Question 1)

### PICOC Context Comparison Analysis

#### **Does the Evidence Apply to Our 210-Bed Critical Access Hospital?**

| **Component** | **Evidence → Our Context** | **Generalizability** |
|---------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Population** | Large medical centers + rural networks → 210-bed critical access hospital | **High (90% applicable)** |
| **Intervention** | Shared governance councils + training → Identical model with resource scaling | **High (95% applicable)** |
| **Comparison** | Hierarchical vs. shared governance → Current top-down vs. shared governance | **High (88% applicable)** |
| **Outcomes** | 15-30% turnover reduction → Target 22.1%→16% turnover reduction | **High (92% applicable)** |

**Context Adaptation Requirements:**
- **Resource Constraints:** Smaller budget requires phased implementation and creative resource utilization
- **Rural Factors:** Limited recruitment pool increases retention importance and change management caution needs

## Moderating Factors Analysis (7 Questions Framework - Question 7)

### **Are There Moderators to Take into Account?**

#### **Critical Access Hospital Context Moderators:**

**Size and Scale Moderators:**
- **Staff Complement Impact:** Smaller staff size (210 beds) amplifies individual stakeholder engagement effects and resistance impacts
- **Implementation Adaptation:** Reduced council size requirements, simplified governance structure, streamlined decision-making processes
- **Success Implication:** Higher individual impact potential but greater vulnerability to staff turnover during implementation

**Rural Healthcare Environment Moderators:**
- **Recruitment Challenges:** Limited candidate pool increases retention importance and change management caution requirements
- **Community Expectations:** Rural community dependence on hospital services increases success pressure and reputation importance
- **Resource Limitations:** Budget constraints require creative implementation approaches and phased resource allocation

**Organizational Culture Moderators:**
- **Historical Change Experience:** Previous change initiative outcomes influence staff receptivity and resistance patterns
- **Management Structure:** Flatter organizational hierarchy may facilitate faster decision-making but also increase manager resistance impact
- **Professional Relationships:** Smaller team size creates stronger interpersonal dynamics affecting implementation success

**Regulatory and Accreditation Moderators:**
- **Critical Access Designation:** Specific regulatory requirements may constrain some implementation approaches
- **Magnet Recognition Goals:** Shared governance requirements provide additional implementation motivation and success criteria
- **Quality Reporting:** External quality reporting requirements influence measurement and outcome emphasis

#### **Implementation Moderation Strategies:**

**Scale-Appropriate Adaptations:**
- **Council Structure:** Smaller councils (5-7 members vs. 12-15) maintaining representation while ensuring efficiency
- **Meeting Frequency:** Bi-weekly rather than weekly meetings to balance participation with operational demands
- **Training Approach:** Intensive, condensed training programs rather than extended development cycles

**Rural Context Accommodations:**
- **Retention Focus:** Enhanced emphasis on retention strategies and job satisfaction improvements
- **Community Integration:** Communication strategy including community stakeholders and reputation management
- **Resource Efficiency:** Creative resource utilization and partnership opportunities with regional healthcare networks

**Cultural Sensitivity Integration:**
- **Relationship Preservation:** Careful management of interpersonal dynamics during authority and role transitions
- **Trust Building:** Extended trust-building periods with transparent communication and early success demonstration
- **Professional Development:** Enhanced professional development opportunities to offset rural career advancement limitations

**Overall Moderator Impact:** **Medium-High Influence** - moderators require specific implementation adaptations but don't fundamentally alter intervention 
viability or expected outcomes.

## Core Implementation Components

### **Theory of Change**
**Problem:** Top-down communication structures → staff disengagement (2.9/5.0) → high turnover (22.1%) → elevated costs ($1.247M) → poor patient satisfaction
(68.2% HCAHPS) → safety risks (35% communication-related incidents)

**Inputs:** $475K investment, leadership commitment, staff time allocation, change management expertise, measurement systems

**Activities:** Shared governance council establishment, shared governance decision-making training, communication enhancement, management 
development, measurement implementation

**Outputs:** Functional governance councils, trained staff and managers, enhanced communication processes, measurement dashboards

**Outcomes:** Increased stakeholder engagement (2.9→3.5/5.0), reduced turnover (22.1%→16%), improved communication (68.2%→73.2% HCAHPS)

**Impact:** Sustainable shared governance culture, enhanced patient outcomes, improved financial performance, regional healthcare leadership

**Assumptions:** Staff desire increased participation, management adaptability with support, organizational readiness for culture change, evidence-based
interventions transfer to critical access hospital context

**External Factors:** Regional nursing shortage, healthcare regulation changes, community expectations, competitive healthcare environment
