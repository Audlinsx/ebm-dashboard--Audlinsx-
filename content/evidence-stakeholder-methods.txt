# Stakeholder Evidence: Methods & Engagement Strategy
# Document your approach to gathering stakeholder perspectives and feedback

## Stakeholder Evidence Goals
**Primary Goal:** Gather comprehensive stakeholder perspectives on how communication problems between management levels impact daily work experience, 
patient care quality, and organizational effectiveness in healthcare settings
**Secondary Goal:** Collect stakeholder feedback on feasibility, implementation concerns, and support levels for proposed communication improvement 
solutions (structured protocols, shared governance, leadership development)

## Target Stakeholder Groups
