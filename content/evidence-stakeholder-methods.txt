- **Night Shift Participation:** Slightly lower participation from night shift workers despite targeted outreach
- **New Employee Input:** Employees with <6 months tenure may have limited perspective on communication patterns
- **Part-time Worker Participation:** Lower response rate from part-time and per diem employees

**Selection Effects:**

- **Social Desirability:** Responses may be influenced by perceived organizational expectations
- **Question Ordering Effects:** Question sequence may influence responses to subsequent items

**Focus Group Limitations:**
- **Group Dynamics:** Dominant personalities may influence group responses
- **Social Conformity:** Pressure to agree with group consensus may suppress dissenting views
- **Facilitator Bias:** Facilitator perspectives may inadvertently influence discussion direction
- **Artificial Setting:** Conference room discussions may not reflect natural workplace communication

#### Interview and Feedback Session Constraints
**Individual Interview Limitations:**
- **Time Constraints:** Limited interview time may not allow full exploration of complex issues
- **Interviewer Effects:** Different interviewers may elicit different types of responses

- **Contradictory Findings:** Resolution of conflicts between different stakeholder perspectives
- **Context Loss:** Risk of losing important contextual information during data integration
- **Generalization Limits:** Findings may not generalize to all departments or future organizational states

#### Validity Considerations
**Internal Validity:**
- **Temporal Changes:** Stakeholder perspectives may change during data collection period
- **External Influences:** Outside factors (healthcare environment changes, media coverage) may influence responses
- **Measurement Error:** Imperfect instruments may not capture true stakeholder perspectives
- **Researcher Interpretation:** Analyst perspectives may influence theme identification and interpretation

**External Validity:**
- **Organizational Specificity:** Findings may not generalize to other healthcare organizations
