## 6. Limitations and Considerations

### 6.1 Data Collection Limitations
- **Night Shift Underrepresentation:** 22% response rate vs. 67% overall
- **Physician Participation:** 34% response rate may limit medical staff insights
- **Self-Selection Bias:** Voluntary participation may overrepresent engaged stakeholders

### 6.2 Contextual Considerations
- **COVID-19 Impact:** Data collected during pandemic recovery period
- **Organization-Specific Factors:** Results may not generalize to all healthcare settings
- **Change Fatigue:** Stakeholder enthusiasm may decline during implementation

**Evidence Summary:** This comprehensive stakeholder analysis provides robust foundation for evidence-based healthcare communication improvement. The 
67% response rate from 7,234 stakeholders demonstrates strong organizational engagement, while the 84% problem recognition and 81% solution support 
indicate high feasibility for structured communication interventions. Implementation should prioritize management training, structured communication 
protocols, and protected time for sustainable culture change.
