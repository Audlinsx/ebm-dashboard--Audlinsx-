## Expected Challenges

### Data Availability
**Anticipated Limitations:**
- Night shift worker underrepresentation in surveys and engagement data requiring targeted collection strategies
- Physician data limited by low survey response rates (34%) and autonomous practice patterns affecting organizational data integration
- Communication-specific historical baselines limited, requiring custom dashboard development for trend analysis beyond 2022
- Cross-departmental data integration complexity given varying data collection practices and system utilization across clinical areas

### Data Quality Issues
**Potential Problems:**
- Self-report bias in engagement surveys and exit interviews requiring triangulation with objective performance measures
- Response rate variation by department and shift creating potential selection bias in communication effectiveness measurements
- Incident reporting completeness varies by unit culture and safety climate, potentially underestimating communication-related safety events
- Financial impact modeling requires assumptions about indirect costs and opportunity costs that may be conservative or optimistic

### Access Barriers
**Anticipated Obstacles:**
- HIPAA compliance requirements for any patient-related data may limit depth of care coordination and patient satisfaction analysis
- Union notification and approval processes for employee surveys and workforce data analysis may extend timeline
- Medical staff governance requirements for physician-related data collection may require separate approval processes
- Competitive information sensitivity around financial performance and benchmarking data may limit external sharing

### Time Constraints
**Resource Limitations:**
- IRB approval process typically requires 4-6 weeks which may delay data collection timeline
- Data extraction from multiple systems requires IT support coordination around maintenance schedules and priority queues
- Key stakeholder availability (executives, department directors) limited by operational demands and may require flexible scheduling
- Analysis complexity with 12 integrated data systems may require iterative approach rather than comprehensive single analysis

## Backup Plans

### Alternative Data Sources
**Primary Alternatives:**
- If engagement survey data unavailable: Use exit interview trends, grievance patterns, and informal feedback from leadership rounding
- If HCAHPS data restricted: Substitute internal patient satisfaction surveys and complaint analysis for communication assessment
- If financial system access limited: Use publicly available CMS cost data and industry benchmarks for cost estimation validation
- If physician data insufficient: Focus analysis on nursing and support staff with physician engagement treated as implementation consideration

### Proxy Measures
**Substitute Metrics:**
- Communication effectiveness proxy: Meeting effectiveness scores, policy comprehension assessments, information cascade timing analysis
- Employee engagement proxy: Voluntary overtime rates, internal promotion acceptance rates, training program participation levels
- Patient satisfaction proxy: Complaint volume trends, discharge planning effectiveness, family conference completion rates
- Safety culture proxy: Near-miss reporting rates, safety suggestion submissions, safety committee participation levels

### Simplified Analysis
**Minimum Viable Evidence:**
- Core requirement: Demonstrate communication problems exist (turnover correlation, satisfaction scores) and solution feasibility (budget, 
historical success)
- Essential metrics: Turnover rates with exit interview themes, patient satisfaction communication scores, available budget analysis
- Sufficient benchmarking: National healthcare averages from publicly available CMS and industry sources
- Adequate validation: Cross-reference internal findings with published healthcare communication research for consistency and credibility

**Implementation Timeline:** 8-week data collection period following IRB approval, with rolling analysis and validation occurring throughout 
collection phase. Weekly stakeholder updates and monthly preliminary findings reports to maintain organizational engagement and support throughout 
the evidence gathering process.
