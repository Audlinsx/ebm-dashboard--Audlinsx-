## Implications for Decision Making

### How to Weight Scientific Evidence
**Primary Weight (70%):** Scientific evidence provides strong foundation for decision-making, particularly for structured communication 
interventions with demonstrated effectiveness across multiple high-quality studies.

**Supporting Evidence (30%):** Practitioner wisdom and organizational context should supplement scientific evidence, particularly for 
implementation strategy, resource allocation, and adaptation to specific organizational cultures.

### Evidence-Based Recommendations
**Strongly Supported by Evidence:**
1. **Implement Daily Structured Communication:** Multiple RCTs demonstrate effectiveness of daily huddles and leadership rounds 
(effect sizes d=0.6-0.8)
2. **Develop Psychological Safety Foundation:** Consistent evidence shows psychological safety as prerequisite for communication effectiveness
3. **Balanced Technology Approach:** Evidence supports combining digital tools with face-to-face communication rather than technology-only solutions
4. **Multi-Component Interventions:** Studies consistently show multi-component approaches (training + structure + culture) outperform single 
interventions

**Moderately Supported by Evidence:**
1. **Shared Governance Models:** Strong evidence in nursing contexts, but limited evidence for broader healthcare application
2. **Leadership Communication Training:** Good evidence for effectiveness, but optimal training approaches and duration less clear
3. **Crisis Communication Preparedness:** COVID evidence supports importance, but specific preparedness strategies need further research

### Areas Requiring Other Evidence Types
**Implementation Strategy:** Scientific evidence provides limited guidance on optimal implementation sequences, change management approaches, 
and resistance handling - requires heavy reliance on practitioner wisdom.

**Organizational Culture Assessment:** Limited scientific tools for assessing baseline communication culture and readiness for change requires 
organizational assessment expertise.

**Resource Allocation:** Minimal cost-effectiveness research requires organizational financial analysis and practitioner judgment for 
investment decisions.

**Sustainability Planning:** Limited long-term evidence requires combination of short-term research findings with practitioner experience 
in sustaining organizational changes.
