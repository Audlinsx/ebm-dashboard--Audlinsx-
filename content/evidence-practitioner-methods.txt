## Expected Challenges

### Access Challenges
High-profile healthcare leaders have limited availability and extensive demands on their time; institutional gatekeepers may limit direct access; 
geographic distribution of experts may limit in-person interaction possibilities.

### Response Rate Concerns
Healthcare leaders receive numerous research requests; academic timeline may not align with their availability; some experts may prefer not to 
go beyond their published materials.

### Quality Concerns
Risk of receiving generic responses rather than specific, actionable insights; potential for experts to focus on theoretical rather than 
practical implementation challenges; need to distinguish evidence-based insights from personal opinions.

### Time Constraints
Academic research timeline may not allow for optimal expert availability; healthcare industry demands may limit expert engagement 
during critical periods (budget cycles, regulatory submissions, etc.).
