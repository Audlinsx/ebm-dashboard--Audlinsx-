# Stakeholder Analysis
# Identify and analyze all parties affected by your problem and solution

## Internal Stakeholders

### Senior Management
- **Interest in Problem:**  Senior leaders may see operational inefficiencies (higher overtime, agency staffing costs) when staff morale falls,
or Senior leaders face lower organizational performance when frontline disengagement increases errors, turnover, and lost productivity 
(senior leaders lose institutional knowledge and pay recruitment costs).

And improved implementation success of strategic initiatives through line-level buy-in.

top-down edicts without consultation make their jobs harder. They may face blame for poor morale or poor performance metrics they cannot control.

## Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

### High Influence, High Interest (Manage Closely)
Stakeholders: Senior Management, HR, Quality & Safety
Approach: Regular executive briefings, ROI modeling, steering committee membership, co-design workshops
Use pilot data to secure buy-in.

### High Influence, Low Interest (Keep Satisfied)
Stakeholders: External regulators, large partner contractors. 
Approach: Periodic updates, compliance reports; emphasize safety and accreditation benefits.

### Low Influence, High Interest (Keep Informed)
Stakeholders: Frontline staff, patient advocacy groups.
Approach: Frequent town halls, unit meetings, surveys, transparent action logs showing how feedback is used.

### Low Influence, Low Interest (Monitor)
Stakeholders: Peripheral vendors, distant community groups. 
Approach: Periodic newsletters; minimal engagement until impact changes

## Key Stakeholder Insights for Evidence Collection

### Who to Interview/Survey
 Unit/charge nurses, middle managers, HR/quality director, patient experience lead

### What Questions to Ask
Frontline staff: “How often are you consulted about workflow changes?” and “How comfortable are you speaking up about safety?”
Middle managers: “Which top-down decisions caused the most implementation friction?”; “What support would make staff participation feasible?”
Senior leaders: “What outcomes/metrics would convince you to expand shared governance?”
HR/Quality: “What are current turnover costs and safety incident trends?”

### How to Engage
Mixed methods: short surveys, semi-structured interviews, unit focus groups, shadowing, 
document review (turnover stats, incident reports), and Use anonymous options to encourage honesty
