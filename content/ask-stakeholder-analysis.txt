# STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS: Who Wins and Loses with Communication Change

## Communication Crisis Impact by Stakeholder Group

### Executive Leadership (89% Support - High Influence)
**How Communication Crisis Hurts Them:**  
- $2.5M annual cost from communication-related problems (turnover, safety events, inefficiency)
- Reputation damage from poor patient satisfaction scores (68.2% HCAHPS, 40th percentile)
- Strategic objectives blocked by frontline disengagement and resistance

**How Shared Governance Helps Them:**
- 302% ROI through $905K annual benefits vs $475K investment
- Improved quality metrics and patient satisfaction (73.2% HCAHPS target)
- Reduced regulatory risk from communication-related safety events

**Implementation Role:** Budget approval, resource allocation, organizational commitment, cultural leadership
**Support Strategy:** Business case emphasis, ROI demonstration, regional recognition positioning

### Middle Management
**Interest in Problem:** Middle managers shoulder day-to-day frustrations of reconciling top directives with frontline constraints; top-down orders without 
consultation makes their job harder. They may face blame for poor morale or poor performance metrics which they cannot control
**Interest in Solution:** They will gain a clearer, co-created workflow, reduced conflict between staff and executives, and stronger unit performance. But a 
risk includes added workload to participate in governance structures, like the time needed to attend meetings
**Influence Level:** High/Medium,translate policy into practice; can champion or block change
**Support Level:** Likely supporter, if process reduces their burden; potentially resistant if perceived as more administrative work

### Employees/Staff
**Interest in Problem:** Staff experience lower morale, higher burnout and intention to leave when excluded from decisions affecting their work
Lack of voice reduces job satisfaction and psychological safety, which can decrease reporting of safety concerns
**Interest in Solution:** They will gain a voice in practice, improved job satisfaction, career empowerment, lower intention to quit
**Perceived cost:** time away from clinical duties to attend committee meetings
**Influence Level:** Medium/Low influence on solution success, collective voice matters; unions or councils can exert influence
**Support Level:** Strong likely supporters, they benefit from a participatory model


### Other Internal Groups
**Department/Group:** Human Resources
**Interest in Problem:** High costs and operational burden from turnover is placed on them
**Interest in Solution:** High turnover rate and understaffing will no longer be an issue they have to constantly fix
**Influence Level:** High, they can incorporate policy and retention programs
**Support Level:** Likely a supporter

**Department/Group:** Quality/Risk Management 
**Interest in Problem:** Poor communication reduces incident reporting and learning
**Interest in Solution:** Safety and hospital ratings will hopefully increase, which is what any hospital wants 
**Influence Level:** Medium, they can mandate improvement initiatives
**Support Level:** Likely a supporter
## External Stakeholders

### Customers/Clients
**Interest in Problem:** Reduced staff engagement can degrade care quality, safety, and patient experience
**Interest in Solution:** Better continuity, fewer errors, higher satisfaction
**Influence Level:** Medium influence through feedback/loyalty, via complaints, patient surveys, HCAHPS scores
**Support Level:** Likely supporter

### Suppliers/Partners
**Interest in Problem:** High turnover increases reliance on agency staff; a business for agencies
**Interest in Solution:** Agencies may resist if it reduces demand, and training vendors may support and used as a business opportunity
**Influence Level:** Medium/Low influence on solution
**Support Level:** Likely a mixture of a supporter/neutral/resistant

### Regulatory Bodies
**Interest in Problem:** Workforce stability and safe staffing are linked to regulatory standards and accreditation
**Interest in Solution:** Solutions that improve safety and retention align with compliance
**Influence Level:** High regulatory power and can enforce standards
**Support Level:** Likely supportive if evidence shows gains in safety 

### Community/Society
**Interest in Problem:** Workforce shortages reduce access to care, a local economy may suffer from high turnover
**Interest in Solution:** The community benefits from stable, high-quality services
**Influence Level:** Medium/Low through public opinion, and political pressure
**Support Level:** Likely community response is supportive

## Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

### High Influence, High Interest (Manage Closely)
**Stakeholders:** Senior Management, HR, Quality & Safety
**Approach:** Regular executive briefings, ROI modeling, steering committee membership, co-design workshops, use pilot data to secure buy-in

### High Influence, Low Interest (Keep Satisfied)
**Stakeholders:** External regulators, large partner contractors
**Approach:** Periodic updates, compliance reports, emphasize safety and accreditation benefits

### Low Influence, High Interest (Keep Informed)
**Stakeholders:** Frontline staff, patient advocacy groups
**Approach:** Frequent town halls, unit meetings, surveys, transparent action logs showing how feedback is used

### Low Influence, Low Interest (Monitor)
**Stakeholders:** Peripheral vendors, distant community groups
**Approach:** Periodic newsletters, have minimal engagement until impact changes

## Key Stakeholder Insights for Evidence Collection

### Who to Interview/Survey
- Unit/charge nurses
- Middle managers
- HR/quality director
- Patients on their experience

### What Questions to Ask
**Frontline staff:** “How often are you consulted about workflow changes?” and “How comfortable are you speaking up about safety?”
**Middle managers:** “Which top-down decisions caused the most implementation friction?” and “What support would make staff participation feasible?”
**Senior leaders:** “What outcomes/metrics would convince you to expand shared governance?”
**HR/Quality:** “What are current turnover costs and safety incident trends?”

### How to Engage
**Mixed methods:** 
- Short surveys
- Semi-structured interviews
- Unit specific focus groups
- Shadowing
- Document review or turnover stats, incident reports, etc
- Anonymous options to help encourage honesty
