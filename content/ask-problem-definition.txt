# Problem Definition Framework
## X → Y Framework
### Current State: Decision-making is top-down, communication is one-directional → staff feel disengaged, undervalued, and turnover intention is high
Healthcare organizations often rely on exclusive top-down decisions, where policy and workflow changes are dictated by senior management with little input 
from frontline staff. Thus this downward, one-way communication leaves staff feeling unheard, disengaged, and undervalued. Consequences include low morale, 
high turnover intention, and reduced staff trust in leadership

### Desired State: Shared governance and participatory communication → staff are engaged, psychologically safe, and more encouraged to stay
Establish shared governance structures that empower lower level staff to participate in policy, workflow, and quality improvement decisions. Implementing 
a participatory communication model will hopefully result in higher engagement, morale, retention, and strengthen the organizational culture

## PICOC Framework
### Population
Multidisciplinary healthcare staff teams (nurses, doctors, techs), Upper-level management (C-suite and program directors)

### Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)
Shared governance or participatory decision-making (staff involvement in policy/workflow decisions). Improve communication tools for downward & upward 
communication (inclusive decision forums)

### Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)
Traditional Top-down decision making, no staff involvement, settings where communication is unidirectional (Upper-level down only)

### Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)
Increased staff engagement, lower turnover intention, higher work morale

### Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)
This would apply to medium-large hospitals as well as off-site satellite location, and any form of healthcare facility 

## Clear Problem Statement
Insufficient communication between upper management and lower-level employees within healthcare organizations, result in pervasive misunderstandings, 
employee disengagement, and a disconnect between organizational strategy and daily operations


## Why This Problem Matters
### Impact on Organization
- Staff disengagement and morale issues lead to higher turnover rates, which is costly (recruitment, training, loss of continuity)
- Participatory decision-making with good leadership enhance employee satisfaction, improve teamwork, foster innovation, and help with staff retention
- High turnover and low morale impair patient care, increase the risk of errors, degrade service quality, and reduce employee productivity

### Stakeholder Impact
**Senior Management:**
**Problem:** Disengaged staff reduce operational efficiency and patient care quality, affecting organizational Key Performance Indicators (KPIS)
**Solution:** Implementing participatory communication improves retention, engagement, and workflow compliance

**Middle Management:**
**Problem:** Middle managers must reconcile top-down directives with frontline realities, leading to stress and implementation friction
**solution:** Involving them in shared governance reduces friction, clarifies priorities, and empowers them to support their staff

**Frontline Staff** (Nurses, Clinician, Physicians):
**Problem:** Excluded from decisions → low morale, burnout, high turnover intention
**Solution:** Shared governance and participatory decision-making increase voice, job satisfaction, and commitment to the job

**Internal Groups ** (HR, Quality & Safety):
**Problem:** High turnover and low engagement increase the administrative burden and risk reporting gaps
**Solution:** Lower turnover and higher engagement among employees will reduce administrative load and enhance safety compliance

**External Stakeholders**

**Patients/Clients:**
**Problem:** Higher staff disengagement can reduce quality of care, safety, and patient satisfaction
**Solution:** Higher engagement leads to better communication, safer and quality care, as well as improve patient satisfaction.

**Suppliers/Partners:**
**Problem:** High turnover drives reliance on temporary staff, increasing costs
**solution:** Retention reduces dependency on agency staff; vendors may benefit from stability and predictability

**Regulatory Bodies:**
**Problem:** Workforce instability may compromise compliance with staffing and safety regulations
**Solution:** Improved engagement and retention align with hospital accreditation standards

**Community/Society:**
**Problem:** Poor retention and staff burnout affect access to care and overall community health
**Solution:** Stabilized workforce improves continuity of care and public trust

### Strategic Alignment
**Organizational Goals:**
- Staff retention and engagement are critical to achieve quality, safety, and patient satisfaction KPIs
- Shared governance and participatory decision-making to align with the goal of emphasizing employee empowerment and patient-centered care

**Operational Priorities:**
- Reducing turnover lowers costs associated with recruitment and agency staffing
- Enhancing communication channels to directly support continuous improvement initiatives and patient safety priorities

## Evidence Questions to Explore
### For the Problem (Step 2)
**What evidence shows this problem exists?**
- High turnover rates linked to top-down decision-making and poor engagement in hospital units
- Low psychological safety and reduced staff voice are correlated with hierarchical, non-participatory leadership
**How widespread is this problem?**
- Surveys across multiple countries show a 20–30% voluntary nurse turnover in hospitals with low staff involvement in decisions 
- Engagement gaps affect developed and low-resource healthcare systems, suggesting a systemic issue
**What are the root causes?**
- Exclusive top-down communication, a lack of structured forums for staff input (shared governance councils, multidisciplinary huddles)
- Middle management is not empowered to translate feedback upward

### For the Solution (Step 4)
**What evidence supports our preferred solution?**
- Shared governance, participatory decision-making, and transformational leadership increase engagement and retention
- Psychological safety interventions lead to more reporting, improved morale, and retention
**Has this solution worked in similar contexts?**
- In Rwanda, participatory decision-making and staff involvement reduced turnover
- In U.S. hospitals, implementing shared governance councils improved engagement scores and reduced turnover
**What are the potential risks and benefits?**
**Risks:** Initial increase in staff workload attending governance meetings, and potential resistance from managers who fear loss of control
**Benefits:** Higher staff engagement, morale, and retention, improved patient satisfaction and safety outcomes. Reduced turnover and agency staff costs
