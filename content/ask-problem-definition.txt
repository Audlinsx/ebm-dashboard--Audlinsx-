# Problem Definition Framework
# Use this template to clearly define your management problem

## X → Y Framework
### Current State (X - What's happening now that's problematic?): Decision-making is top-down, communication is one-directional → staff feel disengaged, undervalued, and turnover intention is high.
Healthcare organizations often rely on exclusive top-down decisions, where policies and workflow changes are dictated by senior management with little input from frontline staff. 
Thus this downward, one-way communication leaves staff feeling unheard, disengaged, and undervalued. Consequences include low morale, high turnover intention, and reduced staff trust in leadership.

### Desired State (Y - Outcome we want to achieve?): Shared governance and participatory communication → staff are engaged, psychologically safe, and more likely to stay.
Establish shared governance structures that empower lower level staff to participate in policy, workflow, and quality improvement decisions. By implementing participatory communication models, 
to hopefully result in higher engagement, morale, and retention, while strengthening the organizational culture.

## PICOC Framework
### Population 
Multidisciplinary healthcare staff teams (inc. nurses, doctos, techs), Upper level management (C-suite, program directors, etc)

### Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)
Shared governance or participatory decision-making (staff involvement in policy/workflow decisions). Improve communication tools for downward & upward communication (inclusive decision forums)

### Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)
Traditional Top-down decision making, no staff involvement, settings where communivation is unidirectional (upper level down only)

### Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)
Increased staff engagement, lower turnover intention, higher work morale

### Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)
This would apply to medium-large hospitals as well as any off-site sattelite location, and any other form of healthcare facility 

## Clear Problem Statement
Poor communication between upper-level management and lower-level employees results in misunderstandings, low engagement, and misalignment of organizational goals, with a specific focus in healthcare 

## Why This Problem Matters
### Impact on Organization
Staff disengagement and morale issues lead to higher turnover rates, which is costly (recruitment, training, loss of continuity). Participatory decision-making and good leadership styles 
can enhance employee satisfaction, improve teamwork, foster innovation, and help retain staff in challenging settings. High turnover and low morale impair patient care, 
increase the risk of errors, degrade service quality, and reduce employee productivity

### Stakeholder Impact
Senior Management:
Problem: Disengaged staff reduce operational efficiency and patient care quality, affecting organizational Key Performance Indicators (KPIS).
Solution: Implementing participatory communication improves retention, engagement, and workflow compliance.

Middle Management:
Problem: Middle managers must reconcile top-down directives with frontline realities, leading to stress and implementation friction.
Solution: Involving them in shared governance reduces friction, clarifies priorities, and empowers them to support their staff.

Frontline Staff (Nurses, Clinician, Physicians):
Problem: Excluded from decisions → low morale, burnout, high turnover intention.
Solution: Shared governance and participatory decision-making increase voice, job satisfaction, and commitment to the job.

Internal Groups (HR, Quality & Safety):
Problem: High turnover and low engagement increase the administrative burden and risk reporting gaps.
Solution: Lower turnover and higher engagement among employees will reduce administrative load and enhance safety compliance.

External Stakeholders
Patients/Clients:
Problem: Higher staff disengagement can reduce quality of care, safety, and patient satisfaction.
Solution: Higher engagement leads to better communication, safer and quality care, as well as improve patient satisfaction.

Suppliers/Partners:
Problem: High turnover drives reliance on temporary staff, increasing costs.
Solution: Retention reduces dependency on agency staff; vendors may benefit from stability and predictability.

Regulatory Bodies:
Problem: Workforce instability may compromise compliance with staffing and safety regulations.
Solution: Improved engagement and retention align with hospital accreditation standards.

Community/Society:
Problem: Poor retention and staff burnout affect access to care and overall community health.
Solution: Stabilized workforce improves continuity of care and public trust.

### Strategic Alignment
Organizational Goals:
Staff retention and engagement are critical to achieving quality, safety, and patient satisfaction KPIs. Shared governance and participatory decision-making align with 
mission statements emphasizing employee empowerment and patient-centered care.

Operational Priorities:
Reducing turnover lowers costs associated with recruitment and agency staffing. Enhancing communication channels directly supports continuous improvement initiatives and patient safety priorities.

## Evidence Questions to Explore
### For the Problem (Step 2)
- What evidence shows this problem exists?
High turnover rates linked to top-down decision-making and poor engagement in hospital units. Low psychological safety and reduced staff voice are correlated with hierarchical, non-participatory leadership
- How widespread is this problem?
Surveys across multiple countries show a 20–30% voluntary nurse turnover in hospitals with low staff involvement in decisions. Engagement gaps affect developed and low-resource healthcare systems, suggesting a systemic issue
- What are the root causes?
Exclusive top-down communication, a lack of structured forums for staff input (shared governance councils, multidisciplinary huddles). Middle management is not empowered to translate feedback upward

### For the Solution (Step 4)
- What evidence supports our preferred solution?
Shared governance, participatory decision-making, and transformational leadership increase engagement and retention. Psychological safety interventions lead to more reporting, improved morale, and retention.
- Has this solution worked in similar contexts?
In Rwanda, participatory decision-making and staff involvement reduced turnover. While in U.S. hospitals, implementing shared governance councils improved engagement scores and reduced turnover.
- What are the potential risks and benefits?
Risks: Initial increase in staff workload attending governance meetings, and potential resistance from managers who fear loss of control.
Benefits: Higher staff engagement, morale, and retention, improved patient satisfaction and safety outcomes. Reduced turnover and agency staff costs.
