## Research Question
problem: Communication problems between upper and lower level management, with a primary focus on the healthcare industry

2. Psychological Safety and Speaking Up
Primary: How does inadequate communication from upper management affect frontline staff's psychological safety and willingness to report concerns?
Secondary: Which leadership practices or organizational cultures have been shown to increase psychological safety and promote open reporting in healthcare settings?

3. Information Silos Between Management Levels or Departments
Primary: What does research say about the impact of siloed communication between hospital departments or leadership levels on care coordination and patient outcomes?
Secondary: What organizational or technological interventions have been effective in breaking down silos and improving cross-level communication?

4. Top-Down Decision Making and Staff Engagement
Primary: How does poor downward communication or exclusive top-down decision-making influence staff engagement, morale, and retention in healthcare?
Secondary: What participatory communication models or shared governance approaches have improved staff engagement and retention?

6. Leadership Communication and Burnout/Moral Injury
Primary: What connections does research draw between leadership communication quality and burnout or moral injury among healthcare professionals?
Secondary: What communication practices or leadership behaviors have been shown to reduce burnout and support staff well-being?


**Primary Research Question:** [What does research tell us about this problem?]
**Secondary Research Question:** [What does research tell us about potential solutions?]

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Be systematic and comprehensive in your approach
2. Document everything so others could replicate your search
3. Focus on research relevant to both your problem AND potential solutions
4. Use library resources and ask librarians for help with database searches
5. Keep detailed records of what you find and why you include/exclude studies
