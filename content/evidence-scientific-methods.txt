## Research Question
problem: Communication problems between upper and lower level management, with a primary focus on the healthcare industry; Top-Down Decision Making and Staff Engagement
**Primary Research Question:** How does poor downward communication or exclusive top-down decision-making influence staff engagement, morale, and retention in healthcare?
**Secondary Research Question:** What participatory communication models or shared governance approaches have improved staff engagement and retention?
