- **Recency Bias:** 6-year window may miss foundational older research

**Search Term Limitations:**
- **Terminology Variation:** Different terms for communication interventions across disciplines
- **Indexing Inconsistency:** MeSH term application varies across studies
- **Concept Overlap:** Communication research spans multiple disciplinary vocabularies

### 8.2 Study Selection Limitations

**Selection Bias Potential:**
- **Reviewer Subjectivity:** Despite standardized criteria, some judgment required
- **Quality Threshold:** 6.0/10 minimum may exclude valuable lower-quality studies
- **Sample Size Requirements:** >50 participants excludes smaller but well-designed studies
- **Healthcare Focus:** May miss relevant organizational communication research from other sectors

### 8.3 Evidence Synthesis Challenges

**Heterogeneity Issues:**
- **Intervention Diversity:** Wide range of communication interventions limits direct comparison
- **Outcome Measurement Variation:** Different instruments and metrics across studies
- **Context Differences:** Organizational culture and system variations affect generalizability
- **Timeline Variation:** Different follow-up periods complicate outcome comparison
