# Assessment: Monitoring & Evaluation Plan
# Systematic approach to measuring implementation success and organizational impact

## Executive Summary

**Evaluation Overview:** Comprehensive before-and-after assessment using strong baseline data (22.1% turnover, 68.2% HCAHPS, 2.9/5.0 engagement) with 
mixed-methods approach combining quantitative metrics and qualitative stakeholder experiences. **Success thresholds** require ≥20% turnover reduction, ≥75% 
stakeholder satisfaction, and ≥80% implementation fidelity. **Expected outcomes** include 30% turnover reduction (22.1% → 16%), engagement improvement 
(2.9 → 3.5/5.0), patient satisfaction enhancement (68.2% → 73.2% HCAHPS), and 302% annual ROI ($905K benefits vs. ongoing costs).

## Logic Model: X → M → Y Framework

### **X (Intervention): Integrated Evidence-Based Shared Governance Implementation**
- **Component 1:** Comprehensive shared governance councils with participatory decision-making protocols
- **Component 2:** Pilot-based phased implementation for risk mitigation and stakeholder confidence building  
- **Component 3:** Enhanced measurement and continuous improvement system with real-time feedback loops

### **M (Mechanism): Participatory Culture Transformation**
- **Psychological:** Enhanced staff voice/autonomy → increased psychological safety → improved engagement/retention
- **Structural:** Shared decision-making authority → reduced hierarchical barriers → improved communication flow
- **Social:** Collaborative relationships → increased trust/teamwork → enhanced organizational culture
- **Financial:** Improved retention/efficiency → reduced turnover costs → enhanced organizational performance

### **Y (Outcomes): Sustainable Organizational Performance Enhancement**
- **Primary:** Reduced turnover (22.1% → 16%), improved engagement (2.9 → 3.5/5.0), enhanced HCAHPS communication (68.2% → 73.2%)
- **Secondary:** Cost reduction ($905K annual benefits), safety improvement (25% reduction), organizational reputation enhancement
- **Long-term:** Sustainable participatory culture, Magnet readiness, regional healthcare leadership positioning
