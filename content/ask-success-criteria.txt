# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1: Increase Constructive Staff Voice & Reporting
- **Specific:** Increase the average number of constructive safety suggestions or incident reports submitted monthly by staff
- **Measurable:** Achieve a 30% increase in reports/suggestions per 100 staff within 6 months.
- **Achievable:**  Evidence shows higher psychological safety correlates with more reporting of near misses and improvement suggestions
- **Relevant:** Yes this directly address the core problem, Reflects X→Y transition: from silence and disengagement → to active 
contributions in governance and quality.
- **Time-bound:** This be achieved/measured with monthly monitoring; and a benchmark at/around 6 months

### Criterion 2: Reduce Voluntary Turnover
- **Specific:** Reduce annual voluntary turnover 
- **Measurable:** Decrease from baseline, ex 22% to ≤16% within 12 months
- **Achievable:** Yes, this is realistic given resources and constraints; Systematic reviews show governance and leadership 
interventions reduce turnover by 15–30%
- **Relevant:** Yes, this directly address the core problem; Directly addresses the X→Y link: poor top-down communication → 
disengagement → turnover. Solution = participatory communication → stronger retention.
- **Time-bound:** This will be achieved/measured quarterly, with a full-year benchmark at 12 months.

### Criterion 3: Increase inter-department collaboration
- **Specific:** Staff participation in committee meetings, and cross-department collaboration
- **Measurable:** The number of cross-department meetings or joint initiatives initiated
- **Achievable:** This is realistic given resources and constraints, and achievable with existing management structures
- **Relevant:** This directly address the core problem by reducing silos, supports participatory communication
- **Time-bound:** Within 6 months

## Measurement Framework

### Quantitative Metrics
Turnover rate: Annual voluntary turnover % (from HR records).
Staff voice/reporting: # of incident reports and improvement suggestions submitted per 100 staff per month.
Overtime hours: % change compared to a baseline.
Patient satisfaction (HCAHPS communication domain): Target 5% increase within 12 months.
Employee engagement: with a target survey score or rating

**Example metrics:**
- Cost reduction: [Target amount or percentage]
- Time savings: [Target time reduction]
- Quality improvement: [Target quality score]
- Customer satisfaction: [Target rating or score]
- Employee engagement: [Target survey score]

### Qualitative Indicators
Thematic staff feedback in focus groups: perceptions of being heard, valued, and included in decisions.
Meeting documentation showing staff suggestions incorporated into actual policy/workflow.
Narrative examples of positive leadership-staff collaboration.
Enhanced process efficiency

**Example indicators:**
- Improved stakeholder feedback
- Enhanced process efficiency
- Better collaboration
- Reduced conflict or complaints
- Increased innovation or creativity

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

#### Leading Indicators (Early signals of progress)
Increased staff attendance at shared governance meetings, more suggestions submitted within 
the first 3 months, and early uptick in psychological safety survey scores.

#### Lagging Indicators (Final outcomes)
Lower turnover at 12 months, higher HCAHPS communication scores, and sustained reduction in 
overtime and agency staffing costs.

## Baseline Measurements

### Current State Metrics
[Document current performance levels for comparison]

**Metric 1:** Increase Constructive Staff Voice & Reporting = [Current value]
**Metric 2:** Reduce Voluntary Turnover = [Current value]
**Metric 3:** Increase inter-department collaboration = [Current value]

### Data Collection Plan
HR records (turnover), monthly incident reporting dashboards, staff surveys (baseline, 3/6/12 months), focus groups, leadership meeting logs.

## Success Thresholds

### Minimum Acceptable Improvement
a 10% reduction in turnover, a 15% increase in suggestions, Engagement

### Target Performance Level
a 25–30% reduction in turnover to a lower number than the minimum acceptable, and 
a 30% increase in suggestions.

### Stretch Goal
A turnover rate that is <12%, as well as doubling staff suggestions.

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria
### Management Success Measures
Improved quality metrics (fewer adverse events attributable to staffing/communication).

### Employee Success Measures
Staff report feeling listened to (qualitative feedback), improved work-life balance, increased intention to stay.

### Customer Success Measures
Improved HCAHPS communication and overall ratings; fewer complaint incidents.

## Risk Indicators
No improvement or a drop in engagement scores; turnover unchanged or increases; staff report “engagement fatigue”; meetings have poor attendance.

### Red Flags
Engagement or psychological safety scores decline, the meetings have poor attendence, 
and staff reporting drops.

### Mitigation Triggers
Provide protected time for staff participation, adjust leadership training and reframe 
communication of solution benefits to staff.
If no engagement improvement at 3 months → re-assess time commitments, provide protected time for participation, pivot facilitation approach.
If turnover not improving at 6 months → implement targeted retention bonuses or backfill to reduce workload while governance matures.

## Timeline for Assessment

### Short-term (30-90 days)
Governance councils have launched, the baseline surveys by most/all employees are complete; 
and have an early increase in suggestions from staff
Launch pilot shared governance council on 1–2 units; baseline survey; first leadership training sessions.

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
Measurable improvement in engagement and reporting metrics.
Collect engagement survey at 3 months, review suggestion volumes, implement first co-designed changes, present mid-pilot report to steering committee.

### Long-term (6-12 months)
Reduced turnover and improved patient communication scores
12-month turnover and patient-experience assessment, ROI calculation, decision on scale-up.

## Reporting Framework
Progress will be communicated to stakeholders through Dashboards metrics, regular reports and milestone reviews

### Dashboard Metrics
Turnover rate (12-month rolling), engagement score, suggestions/month, overtime hours, HCAHPS domain scores.

### Regular Reports
Monthly ops dashboard to middle managers; quarterly executive summary to senior leadership; staff updates via newsletters / unit huddles.

### Milestone Reviews
3-month, 6-month, 12-month formal evaluations with stakeholders and plan adjustments.
