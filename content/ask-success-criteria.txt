# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1: Increase Constructive Staff Voice & Reporting
**Specific:** Increase the average number of constructive safety suggestions or incident reports submitted monthly by staff
**Measurable:** Achieve a 30% increase in reports/suggestions per 100 staff within 6 months
**Achievable:**  Evidence shows higher psychological safety correlates with more reporting of near misses and improvement suggestions
**Relevant:** Yes this directly address the core problem, Reflects X→Y transition: from silence and disengagement → to active contributions in 
governance and quality
**Time-bound:** This be achieved/measured with monthly monitoring; and a benchmark at/around 6 months

### Criterion 2: Reduce Voluntary Turnover
**Specific:** Reduce annual voluntary turnover 
**Measurable:** Decrease from baseline, ex 22% to ≤16% within 12 months
**Achievable:** This is realistic given resources and constraints; Systematic reviews show governance and leadership interventions reduce turnover by 15–30%
**Relevant:** This directly address the core problem; Directly addresses the X→Y link: poor top-down communication → disengagement → turnover
Solution = participatory communication → stronger retention
**Time-bound:** This will be achieved/measured quarterly, with a full-year benchmark at 12 months

### Criterion 3: Increase inter-department collaboration
**Specific:** Staff participation in committee meetings, and cross-department collaboration
**Measurable:** The number of cross-department meetings or joint initiatives initiated
**Achievable:** This is realistic given resources and constraints, and achievable with existing management structures
**Relevant:** This directly address the core problem by reducing silos, supports participatory communication
**Time-bound:** Within 6 months

## Measurement Framework
### Quantitative Metrics
**Turnover rate:** Annual voluntary turnover % (from HR records)
**Staff voice/reporting:** # of incident reports and improvement suggestions submitted per 100 staff per month
**Overtime hours:** % change compared to a baseline
**Patient satisfaction:** (HCAHPS communication domain) Target 5% increase within 12 months
**Employee engagement:** with a target survey score or rating of 90%
**Quality improvement:** With a target quality score of 90%

### Qualitative Indicators
- Thematic staff feedback in focus groups: perceptions of being heard, valued, and included in decisions
- Meeting documentation showing staff suggestions incorporated into actual policy/workflow
- Narrative examples of positive leadership-staff collaboration
- Enhanced process efficiency


### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

#### Leading Indicators (Early signals of progress)
Increased staff attendance at shared governance meetings, more suggestions submitted within the first 3 months, and early uptick in psychological 
safety survey scores

#### Lagging Indicators (Final outcomes)
Lower turnover at 12 months, higher HCAHPS communication scores, and sustained reduction in overtime and agency staffing costs

## Baseline Measurements

### Current State Metrics
**Metric 1:** Increase Constructive Staff Voice & Reporting = 8 suggestions /month out of 100 staff
**Metric 2:** Reduce Voluntary Turnover = 20%
**Metric 3:** Increase inter-department collaboration = 60%

### Data Collection Plan
- HR records (turnover)
- Monthly incident reporting dashboards
- Staff surveys (baseline, 3/6/12 months)
- Focus groups and leadership meeting logs

## Success Thresholds
### Minimum Acceptable Improvement
- A 10% reduction in turnover
- A 15% increase in suggestions
- Increased engagement

### Target Performance Level
- A 25–30% reduction in turnover to a lower number than the minimum acceptable
- A 30% increase in suggestions

### Stretch Goal
- A turnover rate that is <12%, as well as doubling staff suggestions

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria
### Management Success Measures
- Improved quality metrics (fewer adverse events attributable to staffing/communication)

### Employee Success Measures
- Staff report feeling listened to (qualitative feedback), improved work-life balance, increased intention to stay

### Customer Success Measures
- Improved HCAHPS communication and overall ratings; fewer complaint incidents

## Risk Indicators
- No improvement or a drop in engagement scores
- Turnover is unchanged or increases
- Staff report “engagement fatigue”
- Meetings have poor attendance

### Red Flags
- Engagement or psychological safety scores decline
- Meetings have poor attendence
- Staff reporting drops

### Mitigation Triggers
- Provide protected time for staff participation
- Adjust leadership training and reframe communication of solution benefits to staff
- If no engagement improvement at 3 months → re-assess time commitments, provide protected time for participation, pivot facilitation approach
- If turnover not improving at 6 months → implement targeted retention bonuses or backfill to reduce workload while governance matures

## Timeline for Assessment

### Short-term (30-90 days)
- Launch piolet shared governance councils on 1-2 units 
- Baseline surveys by most/all employees are complete
- Have an early increase in suggestions from staff
- The first leadership training sessions have begun

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
- Measurable improvement in engagement and reporting metrics
- Collect engagement survey at 3 months
- Review suggestion volumes
- Implement first co-designed changes
- Present mid-pilot report to steering committee

### Long-term (6-12 months)
- Reduced turnover and improved patient communication scores
- 12-month turnover and patient-experience assessment
- ROI calculation

## Reporting Framework
- Progress will be communicated to stakeholders through dashboards metrics
- Regular reports and milestone reviews

### Dashboard Metrics
- Turnover rate (12-month rolling)
- Engagement score
- suggestions made per month per 100 employees 
- 0vertime hours 
- HCAHPS domain scores

### Regular Reports
- Monthly ops dashboard to middle managers
- Quarterly executive summary to senior leadership 
- Staff updates through newsletters and unit 'huddles'

### Milestone Reviews
- 3-month, 6-month, 12-month formal evaluations with stakeholders and plan adjustments
