## Synthesis of Organizational Evidence

### Strongest Evidence for Problem Existence
Internal data provides compelling evidence that communication problems significantly impact organizational performance: nursing 
turnover 18% above optimal levels with 67% citing communication issues, HCAHPS communication scores 10 points below national average, 
employee engagement communication subscales 20-30% below healthcare benchmarks, and estimated $7M annual cost from communication-related 
inefficiencies. The convergence of HR metrics, patient satisfaction data, financial impact, and quality indicators creates robust evidence 
base demonstrating both the existence and magnitude of communication problems.

### Strongest Evidence for Solution Feasibility  
Organizational data strongly supports solution feasibility: $1.25M budget allocated specifically for communication improvement, successful 
track record with major change initiatives (73% success rate), existing technology infrastructure (Teams, LMS, SharePoint), pilot program 
success (52% improvement in communication effectiveness in test units), and employee readiness (67% willing to participate). Historical ROI 
of 240% on major initiatives and organization's Magnet designation demonstrate capability to implement complex workforce improvement programs 
successfully.

### Evidence-Based Organizational Readiness Assessment
**High Readiness Factors:** Strong financial capacity ($1.25M allocated), proven change management capability (Epic, Magnet, Lean successes), 
leadership commitment (CEO top 3 priority, Board resolution), existing infrastructure (technology, training systems)

**Medium Readiness Factors:** Employee engagement baseline (3.2/5.0 - moderate foundation for change), current management span of control 
(14.2 - higher than optimal but manageable), physician engagement (low survey response suggests resistance but 76% support systematic improvement)

**Challenging Factors:** Communication skill gaps in management (58-73% below competency in key areas), post-pandemic change fatigue, complex 
organizational structure (4,200 employees across multiple departments), need for sustained culture change vs. tactical solution

### Critical Success Factors Based on Internal Evidence
1. **Sustained Leadership Commitment:** Historical data shows initiatives succeed when leadership maintains visible support beyond 18-month 
implementation period
2. **Adequate Resource Protection:** Successful changes required dedicated FTE and protected budget; communication improvement will need similar 
resource commitment maintained throughout culture change process
3. **Phased Implementation Approach:** Pilot program success (52% improvement) suggests scaling successful models rather than organization-wide 
simultaneous implementation
4. **Management Skill Development Priority:** Competency gaps in 58-73% of managers indicate training investment must precede or accompany structural 
communication changes
5. **Measurement and Accountability Systems:** Organization's data-driven culture and existing analytics capability provide foundation for tracking 
progress and sustaining improvements through performance management integration

---

**Organizational Evidence Summary:** Internal data analysis reveals significant communication problems costing an estimated $7.0M annually with clear 
impacts across workforce (18.7% turnover), patient satisfaction (10 points below national HCAHPS averages), and operational efficiency. 
Strong organizational readiness exists with $1.25M allocated budget, proven change capability (73% initiative success rate), and employee 
willingness to participate (67%). Success factors include sustained leadership commitment, adequate resource protection, phased implementation, 
management development priority, and integration with existing measurement systems.
